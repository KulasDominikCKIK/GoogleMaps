# Description

This a project for my Programming class **@** CKIK

# Last commit

- Fixed that you can't select the buttons.
- I realised I need to resize all the images to 1440x856 because if we are resizing the image in the css file then the map is not working properly.
- I wrote the code to the map with an example so it's working now.

# Plans

- Go to school at the weekends and shoot some photos of the school.

# TODO

- Shoot photos of the school and implement it in the code.
- Do that if the user is pointing on a map then the cursor should be pointer.

# Sources I used

- w3schools.com - I used it for something I don't remember but it's not in anymore so it doesn't matter.
- stackoverflow.com - For some javascript help at the beggining.
- validator.w3.org - For the validation of the HTML code.
