# Description

This a project for my Programming class **@** CKIK

# Last commit

- I made the left & right div.
- I styled the left & right button.
- I took some pictures in my house and coded it (it works but the js is crap).

# Plans

- Go to school at the weekends and shoot some photos of the school.

# TODO

- Shoot photos of the school and implement it in the code.

# Sources I used

- w3schools.com - I used it for something I don't remember but it's not in anymore so it doesn't matter.
- stackoverflow.com - For some javascript help at the beggining.
- validator.w3.org - For the validation of the HTML code.
